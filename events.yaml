- title: Oak Academy Hackathon
  date: 2024-10-22

    Are you an education innovator, creating products to help teachers and pupils? Do you want first access to our open-sourced content?
    
    You’re invited to Oak National Academy’s Hackathon. An open invitation to experiment with our open-source content to create high-impact, exciting ed-tech products that enhance teaching and learning.
    
    We’re looking for a range of participants from established ed-tech teams, education AI experts, thought leaders, engineers and school tech leads to students and graduates.
    
    We want to combine your creativity and expertise with our resources, data and API, enabling you to create new products or features in your existing offers. All to meet the evolving needs of teachers and pupils, including using AI. We will be providing example themes to inspire ideas, but we are keen to see original solutions that tackle the issues teachers and pupils face in education.
    
    Oak is currently working with education partners to create resources that will cover all national curriculum subjects’ content from ages 4-16. Nearly 6,000 lessons have already been released, with thousands more to come over the next 12 months. The majority are available on the Open Government Licence (compatible with Creative Commons). We’re creating an API to allow other organisations and innovators to access, integrate and build their own products off our content.
    
    Our hackathon will be hosted in central London at Ada - The National College for Digital Skills, and will run over Tuesday 22nd and Wednesday 23rd October between 8.30am and 6pm. There’ll be welcome talks from key stakeholders, team hacking time, mini challenges, presentations of final products and a winners' ceremony. We will be providing a light breakfast and lunch for all participants.
    
    Participants can apply as fully-formed teams if they wish, or individuals will be assigned to a team according to their background and skill set.
